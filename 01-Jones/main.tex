\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Writing papers is a core research skillfor any researcher, but they aren’t easy. Writing is not just a way to report on great research; it’s a way to do great research. Yet many papers are so badly written that, even if they describe excellent work, the work has much less impact than it should. In this talk I’ll give you seven simple, actionable guidelines that will, I hope, help you to write better papers, and have more fun at the same time. I don’t have all the answers—far from it—and I hope that the presentation will evolve into a discussion in which you share your own insights, rather than a lecture. The slides and video presentation are available online \footnote{\url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/}}.

Simon Peyton Jones, FRS, graduated from Trinity College Cambridge in 1980. After two years in industry, he spent seven years as a lecturer at University College London, and nine years as a professor at Glasgow University, before moving to Microsoft Research (Cambridge) in 1998.
