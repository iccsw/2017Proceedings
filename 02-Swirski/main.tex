\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
A whirlwind tour through the history and state-of-the-art of JavaScript execution and optimization, with a focus on the V8 engine used by Chrome and Node.js, and how a 10-day prototype became one of the most important programming languages in the world.

Leszek Swirski has been a software engineer at Google for two years, first in California, now in London, working on the performance of the Android camera and the V8 Javascript engine.
Before joining Google, Leszek did a PhD in the University of Cambridge, researching gaze estimation (a.k.a. eye tracking) on stereoscopic (a.k.a. “3D”) displays.
