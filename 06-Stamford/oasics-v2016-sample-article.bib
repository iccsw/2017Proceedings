We show, contrary to a widely- held belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of per- formance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},

abstract = {The aging population is putting an ever increasing burden on healthcare costs, of which care for Heart Failure patients constitutes a major portion. High readmission rates are observed for this large and increasing patient population, which contribute to a large extent to the costs involved in care for Heart Failure. Risk models, when applied in a Clinical Decision Support system, have the potential to help to optimize care based upon expected mortality or readmission. By tailoring care and optimizing care transitions, healthcare costs can be reduced and quality of life of patients may be improved. Although numerous risk models for hospitalized Heart Failure patients have been coined, the uptake of such models in clinical practice is currently very limited. In a quest to identify risk models with high potential and the conditions for successful adaptation, a literature review was performed, identifying 55 Heart Failure risk models, and opportunities explored to apply such models in clinical practice.},

abstract = {A real-time electronic predictive model that identifies hospitalized heart failure (HF) patients at high risk for readmission or death may be valuable to clinicians and hospitals who care for these patients. An automated predictive model for 30-day readmission and death was derived and validated from clinical and nonclinical risk factors present on admission in 1372 HF hospitalizations to a major urban hospital between January 2007 and August 2008. Data were extracted from an electronic medical record. The performance of the electronic model was compared with mortality and readmission models developed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS models) and a HF mortality model derived from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Registry (ADHERE model). The 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 3.1{\%} and 24.1{\%} respectively. The electronic model demonstrated good discrimination for 30 day mortality (C statistic 0.86) and readmission (C statistic 0.72) and performed as well, or better than, the ADHERE model and CMS models for both outcomes (C statistic ranges: 0.72-0.73 and 0.56-0.66 for mortality and readmissions respectively; P {\textless} 0.05 in all comparisons). Markers of social instability and lower socioeconomic status improved readmission prediction in the electronic model (C statistic 0.72 vs. 0.61, P {\textless} 0.05). Clinical and social factors available within hours of hospital presentation and extractable from an EMR predicted mortality and readmission at 30 days. Incorporating complex social factors increased the model's accuracy, suggesting that such factors could enhance risk adjustment models designed to compare hospital readmission rates.},

abstract = {Background Decompensated heart failure (HF) is among the most common indications for hospitalization in the United States, but little is known about features on admission that predict adverse events. We used data from the Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) study to develop a model that would predict outcomes in patients with decompensated HF. Methods and results OPTIME-CHF randomized 949 patients hospitalized with decompensated HF for 48 to 72 hours of infusion of either milrinone or placebo. We used multivariable modeling to evaluate variables on admission that would be predictive of 60-day mortality or the composite of death or rehospitalization at 60 days. Variables at presentation that predicted death at 60 days were increased age, lower systolic blood pressure, New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and decreased sodium. Predictors of the composite of death or rehospitalization within 60 days were the number of HF hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months, elevated BUN, lower systolic blood pressure, decreased hemoglobin, and a history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The discriminatory power of the model was substantial for the mortality model (c-index .77) but less for the composite endpoint (c-index .69). Conclusions Risk stratification of patients with decompensated HF may be accomplished using easily assessed clinical variables. Further research into the validity of this model in independent samples will potentially aid in the development of risk stratification strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical prediction functions. METHODS AND RESULTS This work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P{\textless}.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, approximately 28{\%} of CHD events in men and 29{\%} in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal ({\textgreater} or =130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol ({\textgreater} or =200 mg/dL) was 27{\%} in men and 34{\%} in women. CONCLUSIONS Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.},

Using multivariable piecewise Poisson regression methods with stepwise variable selection, a final model included 13 highly significant independent predictors of mortality in the following order of predictive strength: age, lower EF, NYHA class, serum creatinine, diabetes, not prescribed beta-blocker, lower systolic BP, lower body mass, time since diagnosis, current smoker, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, male gender, and not prescribed ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blockers. In preserved EF, age was more predictive and systolic BP was less predictive of mortality than in reduced EF.

For medications and devices not available in the derivation database, hazard ratios were estimated from published literature. The model was prospectively validated in 5 additional cohorts totaling 9942 heart failure patients and 17,307 person-years of follow-up. The accuracy of the model was excellent, with predicted versus actual 1-year survival rates of 73.4{\%} versus 74.3{\%} in the derivation cohort and 90.5{\%} versus 88.5{\%}, 86.5{\%} versus 86.5{\%}, 83.8{\%} versus 83.3{\%}, 90.9{\%} versus 91.0{\%}, and 89.6{\%} versus 86.7{\%} in the 5 validation cohorts. For the lowest score, the 2-year survival was 92.8{\%} compared with 88.7{\%}, 77.8{\%}, 58.1{\%}, 29.5{\%}, and 10.8{\%} for scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

IHDPS can answer complex ";what if"; queries which traditional decision support systems cannot. Using medical profiles such as age, sex, blood pressure and blood sugar it can predict the likelihood of patients getting a heart disease. It enables significant knowledge, e.g. patterns, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease, to be established.

In this study, a semi-supervised learning based method, Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM), was used in diabetes diseases prediction. The diabetes disease dataset used in this article is Pima Indians diabetes dataset obtained from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases and all patients in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Firstly, LapSVM was trained as a fully-supervised learning classifier to predict diabetes dataset and 79.17{\%} accuracy was obtained. Then, it was trained as a semi-supervised learning classifier and we got the prediction accuracy 82.29{\%}. The obtained accuracy 82.29{\%} is higher than other previous reports. The experiments led to the finding that LapSVM offers a very promising application, i.e., LapSVM can be used to solve a fully-supervised learning problem by solving a semi-supervised learning problem. The result suggests that LapSVM can be of great help to physicians in the process of diagnosing diabetes disease and it could be a very promising method in the situations where a lot of data are not class-labeled.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Xue2008,
abstract = {We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widely- held belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of per- formance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},
