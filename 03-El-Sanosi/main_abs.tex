\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	ZooKeeper is a crash-tolerant system that offers fundamental services to 
Internet-scale applications, thereby reducing the development and hosting of the latter.
It consists of $N\geq3$ servers that form a replicated state machine. 
Maintaining these replicas in a mutually consistent state requires executing 
an Atomic Broadcast Protocol,
\emph{Zab}, so that concurrent requests for state changes 
are serialised identically at all replicas before being acted upon.
Thus, ZooKeeper performance for update operations is determined by Zab performance.
We contribute by presenting two easy-to-implement Zab variants, called \emph{ZabAC} and \emph{ZabAA}. 
They are designed to offer small atomic-broadcast latencies and to reduce the processing load on the 
primary node that plays a leading role in Zab. The former improves ZooKeeper performance and the latter enables ZooKeeper
to face more challenging load conditions.
