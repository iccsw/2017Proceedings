abstract="We present a randomized strategy for maintaining balance in dynamically changing search trees that has optimalexpected behavior. In particular, in the expected case a search or an update takes logarithmic time, with the update requiring fewer than two rotations. Moreover, the update time remains logarithmic, even if the cost of a rotation is taken to be proportional to the size of the rotated subtree. Finger searches and splits and joins can be performed in optimal expected time also. We show that these results continue to hold even if very little true randomness is available, i.e., if only a logarithmic number of truely random bits are available. Our approach generalizes naturally to weighted trees, where the expected time bounds for accesses and updates again match the worst-case time bounds of the best deterministic methods.",

  abstract="The majority of work carried out in the formal methods community throughout the last three decades has (for good reasons) been devoted to special languages designed to make it easier to experiment with mechanized formal methods such as theorem provers, proof checkers and model checkers. In this paper we will attempt to give convincing arguments for why we believe it is time for the formal methods community to shift some of its attention towards the analysis of programs written in modern programming languages. In keeping with this philosophy we have developed a verification and testing environment for Java, called Java PathFinder (JPF), which integrates model checking, program analysis and testing. Part of this work has consisted of building a new Java Virtual Machine that interprets Java bytecode. JPF uses state compression to handle big states, and partial order and symmetry reduction, slicing, abstraction, and runtime analysis techniques to reduce the state space. JPF has been applied to a real-time avionics operating system developed at Honeywell, illustrating an intricate error, and to a model of a spacecraft controller, illustrating the combination of abstraction, runtime analysis, and slicing with model checking.",

Deletions proceed top-down as they do in a previous algorithm due to Rao and Kumar (1988), but insertions proceed bottom-up, and consecutive insertions use a bit-reversal technique to scatter accesses across the fringe of the tree, to reduce contention. Because insertions do not have to traverse the entire height of the tree (as they do in previous work), as many as O(M) operations can proceed in parallel, rather than O(log M) on a heap of size M. Experimental results on a Silicon Graphics Challenge multiprocessor demonstrate good overall performance for the new algorithm on small heaps, and significant performance improvements over known alternatives on large heaps with mixed insertion/deletion workloads."

To our knowledge, it is the first such data structure to efficiently implement a truly parallel priority queue based on a heap structure. Employing p processors, the parallel heap allows deletions of $\theta$(p) highest priority items and insertions of $\theta$(p) new items, each in O(log n) time, where n is the size of the parallel heap. Furthermore, it can efficiently utilize processors in the range 1 through n.",

Inserting O(n) elements or deleting the O(n) out ofmsmallest elements usingnprocessors requires O(Tcoll+ log(m/n)) amortized time with high probability whereTcollbounds the time for performing prefix sums and randomized routing. The memory requirement is bounded by (m/n)(1 +o(1)) + O(logn) whp. These bounds are an improvement over the best previously known algorithms for many interconnection networks and even matches the speed of the best known PRAM algorithms. Generalizations for accessing thek⪢nsmallest elements are even more efficient. A portable implementation using MPI demonstrates that our approach is already useful for medium scale parallelism. Two parallel selection algorithms for randomly placed data are a spin-off. One runs in time O(Tcoll) with high probability, beating a lower bound for the worst case. The other requires only a single reduction operation."
